This example builds on spring-ex01, where Spring Java configuration files replaced the standard Spring MVC template XML 
files created by STS in Eclipse.  In addition, this code shows an end-to-end example of:

MySQL -> Hibernate -> Spring MVC -> JSP

This example has been validated with the following environment on Debian 8:

1. NetBeans 8.0.2
2. Java 1.8.0_40 (separate install)
3. Tomcat 8.0.27 (separate install)
4. Maven 3.3.1 (separate install)
5. MySQL 5.5.44
